                    cleared
                    out behind at Kabul airplane terminal after learning they require substantial travel permits to exit

                <p>With the Taliban quickly seizing cities in the
                    midst of a U.S. military withdrawal, the last-minute hitch has cleared out a few of the Afghans in
                    fear
                    and having to choose whether to isolated their families.</p>

                <h2>New Permanent Residence Online Application Portal for authorized representatives</h2>

                <p>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will launch a new Permanent Residence Online
                    Application Portal (PR Online Application Portal), enabling authorized (paid) immigration
                    representatives to submit permanent residence applications (non-Express Entry) online on behalf of
                    their clients. Following the soft launch and initial testing of the minimal viable product for
                    clients only in March 2021, the PR Online Application Portal will be available to authorized
                    representatives by September 2021.</p>

                <p>Representatives will be able to use the PR Online Application Portal to manage online applications
                    from a single account for multiple clients for permanent residence application streams, which have
                    been paper-based. Paper applications will remain available for those who need an accommodation. The
                    PR Online Application Portal will not be connected to the Authorized Paid Representative Portal.</p>

                <p>To create a PR Online Application Portal account, representatives will need to provide information,
                    including their membership ID number, business address and name, and they will need to upload a
                    valid copy of an identity document (a valid passport, driver’s license or permanent residence card).

                <h2>Immigrant women's programmes in Canada will get $2.1 million in funding to expand their services.
                </h2>

                <p>Ottawa has extended funding for 11 programmes that benefit racialized immigrant women, giving them a
                    $2.1 million boost.
                </p>
                <p>In a statement, Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino stated, “Canada can only realise its full
                    potential if everyone in it achieves theirs.”
                </p>
                <p>“These critical projects will assist racialized newcomer women in establishing the cornerstone of
                    their success: securing a good, well-paying job. </p>

                <h2>What Would a Conservative Victory in the Canadian Federal Election Mean for Immigration? </h2>

                <p>With the development of an accelerated processing stream for those who can afford it, wait times for
                    immigration applications would be drastically reduced under a Conservative government.
                </p>
                <p>In its Secure The Future election platform, Erin O'Toole's Conservative Party promises that "all
                    earnings from this expedited processing fee would be used towards hiring additional employees to
                    streamline processing wait lines even further." </p>
                <p>According to the party, faster processing for individuals who pay for expedited service will also
                    eliminate applications from the regular queue, reducing wait times for all applicants. </p>
